        <h3>Topic 4: Product Positioning 5/20/2018</h3>
        I was reading a book on the topic of a subject's subsconscious by an author whose previous work et al. included Stephen Hawking and it took me a long moment of rumination to decipher what Carl Jung had meant by "subliminal" in his day long before the technological ability to coerce a tiny and fast suggestion into your brain.
        <br><br>
        Subliminal in my understanding referred to the granular level bits of information the mind collects from its environment which holistically builds the animus. In this absorption, certain products are considered more social and "closer to your heart" than their peers. The term social herein also means engaging on a personal level rather than a genre definition. In the process of subliminal repetitive reinforcement of a society's animus (which isn't an emotionally attached thing), the opposing strategy of trying to profile a subject with certain traits that are then "supposed to be associated with certain other traits or outcomes for the good of society" is extremely obvious to anyone sharing that animus to be false profiling.
    <br><br>
        As society becomes intrinsically more intellectual with start-ups harnessing the mass of information available in more and more efficient ways, in this ecology of action the reaction to this snuffing out of false profiling is often a devestating means of slandering, institutional stalking to replace legal investigation, property vandalism, blatant lying in statistical reporting, invasion of property, and anything else that could possibly come to mind. This threatens our society's civility far more than the character being falsely profiled taking a few personal liberties in life.

		<h3>Topic 4: Product Positioning 4/28/2018</h3>
		After this lengthy hiatus from blogging it is now time to roll the red carpet out on our next new topic: where in the marketplace does a given product associate itself? Of all the various approaches to this concern, the first step, on the kernel level of going from taking inventory of possibilities to sensing enough opportunity to develop a motivation, is to determine who the consumers/fanbase/customers are.
		<br><br>
		This first step is possibly the most cerebral, but might also be the most scientific. Not all judgment on this nascent positioning is empirical, unless the product conceiver has personally spoken with each [some number] potential fan individually and knows how they would feel about his product... Which leads us to our final prim and proper assessment.
    <br><br>
		There is an elaboration on the audience-based product conception that encompasses socially-defining the product as it becomes a marketplace participant called 'social proof'. The first social proof a product has is always the rationality of its creator. Then the needed social proof that as humans our hard wiring requires in order to put our trust into a product often comes from the institutional filters of a distribution social system, but equally as often it comes from individual connections with the public within the product's target market crowd in a plotted web.</div>

		<h3>Topic 2: Character Development 2/4/2018</h3>
		Considering the mental activity involved in interpreting writing as a scene, then a story, then an association to the reader's reality and so forth, character development also incorporates mental activity. Concerning the latter, it includes a projection onto the character of how they think throughout their storyline. One thing I must mention on this topic is that I.Q. does not change.
		<br><br>
		With my writing, I use the story to bring out more 'features' of the character's mind and mental capabilities throughout the story that holistically create a person and their traits. This would not be the same interpretation for someone who thinks that I.Q. is a changing variable. Whoever says that to you is lying and is NOT measuring I.Q. They are measuring how much of your capabilities you are using at any given point without mentioning other variables such as energy level, pollutants, being harried versus self control, etc. The mind has evolved similarly to the body according to Doctor Jung (1875-1961), and this has impacted the organ of the brain similarly to other uses/experiences such as drugs. The brain is complex with several balancing acts working alongside several circuits. The brain's I.Q. is a measurement of the brain's hardware capabilities, not its software.
    <br><br>
		This type of fallicy is referred to as a definitional dodge and many cultural influencers are willing to change the definition of academic terms like this which have been defined for several decades, according to their social agenda (also using an appeal to inappropriate authority, an appeal to the gallery, calling an explanation an opinion by hiding the facts, appeal to generalities, several other fallicies). Yes, the hardware may change, but the displacement of the subject among the different weighted mental capabilities such as creative genius, sociological imagination, memory, rationality, geometric understanding, etc. would drop in percentage being used accordingly; it would not change the subject's total score of combined weighted intelligences based purely on their genetics. This lie about I.Q. being a changing variable is supportive of a cultural-economic complex that isn't freedom, and it's not peaceful (competition can be peaceful: separate digression).</div>

<h3>Topic 3: Product Development 1/13/2018</h3>
		It is interesting to read the books of other authors and glean from them what I can concerning their delivery mechanism to their readers' unconscious (not subconscious, but rather the wiring that constrains the mind). Herein, 'product' refers to a book.
		<br><br>
		Lately, I've come across a lot of situationism. I am of the natural disposition to view what is occuring through interactionism due to my focus on hereditary temperament schemas, so my recent reading list has improved my awareness. I like the trope of the urban street class to portray situationism, namely in the books 'Brighton Rock' and 'The Great Train Robbery' (Graham Greene and Michael Crichton, respectively). 
		<br><br>
		From these books I have gleaned that there are three main realms of situationist awareness: the overall societal situation consisting of world views separated by chasms from one social class to another which encompass several interactionist explanations; the situation of the group effort on anything, whether ad hoc, or petty crimes supported in the background by interpersonal relationships, etc., and lastly, the situation of the backgrounds for each individual subject involved in the situation and the tethers therein.</div>
<br><br><br>

<div class="sample">
		<h3>Topic 2: Character Development 12/13/2017</h3>
		I am under the disposition that practical aesthetics includes the character interacting with their environment, whereas the Meisner technique is about the character becoming their reactions to their surroundings.
		<br><br>
		That is why I believe that type casting is more focused on the personality of the player rather than their social identity. The player brings their experiences and heredity to their role as their perceived reality, and then maintains a role within the group. That is why planning is so crucial to accurate casting.</div>
<br><br><br>

<div class="sample">
		<h3>Topic 2: Character Development 11/30/2017</h3>
		There is a sort of binary approach to character description in the narrative school of thought. One of my favorite authors develops a character with interactions and situations, and I can read for 80,000 words and not know the hair color or outfit of the main character. This builds upon the reader's personal background to project their sense of character and creates a sort of visceral reading experience, however, it requires occassional ostensible scenes not related to the storyline to develop the character if we are not being told what style his button shirt is, or what fit her jeans are, etc. For example, one book I am reading has a main character that is a lawyer, so it is implied that he is usually in some sort of broken down formal outfit during his travels.
		<br><br>
		The other side of the coin is that description is used indirectly to move the story along, while using possibly somewhat demonstrative scenes to build the character superceding the storyline. For instance, a recent book I read described an archeologist's outfit as 'chic' to reinforce the fact that the characters were under the donminion of a foreign environment. I use descriptions of outfits as either a supplement or a locum for a sex scene when the privacy hasn't yet been established.</div>

		<h3>Topic 1: Website Building 11/4/2017</h3>
		It seems like the main difference between coding websites and applications (with object oriented programming) is that the assembly for websites is mostly the process of hosting the html and css files, whereas in applications the assembly is partially written into the code as methods among other elements that supplement hosting the pages.</div>

    <h3>Topic 3: Product Development 10/4/2017</h3>
    <p>	Rather than summoning a burnt out audience to continue to hearken to the issue of subject matter conformity among works of fiction ad nauseam, this time we must focus on a topic that may be of great importance to a fictional, pretty, skinny little adopted Indian college girl named Kayla: plot narration.
    <br><br>
    Energy is like the water of society's body. It sometimes manifests itself in the physical environment via verbal statements. It can evaporate or turn stubbornly icy. I have always been mesmorized by the way a truth can be caught by a believer through the gossip of non-believers; mocking, satirizing, making an example of.
    <br><br>
   	In HIGHER EDUCATION, my supernatural-college fiction third manuscript, Kayla's friend Melissa loses her daily routine of day/night in an anxious frenzy after experiencing a supernatural occurrance with Kayla from her discovered antiquity. She goes to the mental hospital, not for girl stuff or boy stuff like anorexia or insomnia caused by the violence of the middle class like so many of us have, but because she had a truly abstract mentality. When her mother tells her friend that Melissa ranted about a magic book releasing the powers of Salem's witches to her girlfriend, hence her trip to the psychologists' den, her girlfriend discreetly tells the believer at the other end of this verbal stream, a man by the name of Alistair who has been coveting this ancient book of Salem for decades.

    <h3>Topic 3: Product Development 9/26/2017</h3>
    <p>	I have good consistency for this topic concerning my current life’s state of affairs; returning to school for software engineering and modeling, hopefully, while bridging the psychological topics from appearance and identity of highlighted books to the self-perception impact that this topic has on readers of highlighted books.
    <br><br>
    It is interesting how a book’s personality can lead to the sense of reality that it represents. I read a book about a government worker who was an investigative spy-assassin (one of the millions of books on this topic that are crowding out all other unisex drama plots from fictional publishing) that included in its inane prose a total domination of the character by their training. Why couldn’t this book be about corporate espionage to be somewhat unique?
    <br><br>
   	When I write into a perceived reality, also called a culture, based on mixing social identity with psychographics, I skip the commoner way of using personality and rather use my writing to create a specific environment and add specific rationality to the characters, whether they are protagonists or implied antagonists.

    <h3>Topic 3: Product Development 8/8/2017</h3>
    <p>There are different viewpoints in the movie industry on where the product of a movie is fully developed and where it continues being constructed.
    <br><br>
    I am of the mindset that a movie is fully developed once the camera stops rolling for good. The players are changed as people from the empirical interactivity, they have a new stature, and the collaborations are over. I consider editing and post production a phase of packaging rather than further development.
    <br><br>
    One great indie movie had professional, high quality editing that may lead the audience to view it as part of the movie's construction; which may be considered a bit of a metamorphosis. They had a purposely lackluster subject matter that they polished up to seem like a professional mockery, making the indie issue secondary to their identity. They also got the right people behind it and marketed to a very young target market: 'Napoleon Dynamite'.
    </p></div>

    <h3>Topic 2: Character Development 7/20/2017</h3>
    <p>I recently finished a book that included a character as a fleeting acquaintance for a supporting character for maybe half a chapter. The book was around 600 pages. The character needed a ride after an accident, and a woman picked him up that was running away from an abusive boyfriend who was a truck driver.
    <br><br>
    The woman answered about the trucker not driving past them concerning truck routes with, "You know, there are routes, and then there are ROUTES."
    <br><br>
    Truly great authors can make a first impression inserted right into the plot development. I personally chose to write about characters predominately traveling for my first book to attempt this. She lends your mind to her background, and in comparison all of a sudden the past 400 pages of watching the supporting character and main characters develop gets "downloaded" into your subconscious all at once due to the comparison of these vastly different people. A sophisticated spy getting upper-handed by a trucker's girlfriend, a metaphor for the "kulaks", as Anne Applebaum pointed out concerning Russian sociological vernacular.

    <h3>Topic 3: Product Development 5/27/2017</h3>
    <p>My general perception of how product development is taught is by placing it before the product's positioning. However, creating intellectual property such as books, other artwork, design-based products including both appearance and designing the working parts of a functional product, affords the developer the ability to do things in the appropriate order: beginning with product positioning and then moving to product development.
    <br><br>
    I begin with the position of a product in the marketplace in order to then filter the appropriate traits of the product, combining both self-defined and socially-defined identities. Also combined is the product identity among its competitors within the same position and the identity of the position among several. Doing things in the traditional reverse order to me seems a bit agricultural.

    <h3>Topic 2: Character Development 5/15/2017</h3>
    <p>The whole purpose of how the English language was structured is to combine character development in storytelling with thought processes. All great American orators were skilled at this use of vocabulary. Other languages, the Romance group, combine storyline with emotion and gender-specific inanimate objects. More often than not, authors sin and focus the logical framework of English on action.

    <p>Really quick- the very first thing that begins a website development for me, at least, isn't the style or layout, or even the call-to-action plan, it's how the website makes the visitor feel.
    <br><br>
    A lot of people make fun of how Noth American psychology is obsessed with behavior, myself included. A website needs to make you feel the big picture. Is it a corporate giant that reflects focus onto its products built in WordPress or is it a personal node to the world? I hope you still consider this website a quick read that makes you consider reaching out to me to work on a project in some aspect of the social sciences / marketing.

    <h5>If I Know HTML and CSS, do I know HTML5 and CSS3?</h5><br>
    <p> I would say if you know one you know the other. It's not like Java and Javascript where they are completely different languages with similar names. It's more like C++ where the ISO/EIC updates its standard library every three years: 2011, 2014, 2017, etc.<br><br>
    It's the same language with a few new formats from the original. The trick is, some people reading your resume don't know this and will assume you only know a language that is thirty years old. You don't want them thinking that you are a "Nintendo-lilly". Then, if they question you simply show them your code and ask them if you know it or not.</p></div>

<h3>Topic 1: Website Building 5/3/2017</h3>
<p> The main reason why I chose to make this website by coding it myself instead of using WordPress is because
I thought of this exact design one day while I was sitting in Starbucks in Koreatown in Los Angeles on Wilshire, looking out the window at the afternoon west coast cityscape, thinking how it would compile all of my abilities for an overall personal introduction within the part of life of my career.<br><br>
WordPress is heavily focused on photography. I wanted this website to be a fast read, instead of a visit more fitting to a business rather than a person. I'm tuning it up as I go in my spare time, troubleshooting my CSS code organically.
