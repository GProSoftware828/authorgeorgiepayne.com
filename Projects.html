  <h4>Book Excerpt:</h4>
  <p>I stand at the window in our suiteâ€™s living room and stare blankly at the city landscape, pondering the confrontation at our gun deal in Boston. Taking those pistols was a risk.<br><br>

  Cars crawl along the distant highways on this foggy morning, and it seems like I might have to swallow my pride and keep a long distance between our boss and us after our mistake. The deal in five hours might be the end of my life.<br><br>

  I sip my water and things slow down. My mind compresses as my possibly impending death intensifies my concentration. I stare out the window and assess why this is my current environment. I have five hours to live. For a twenty two year old man taking on the entire world, I threw down as much as anyone else could have. The water sinks down my esophagus and the chill from the window glass makes it to my cheeks.<br><br>

  With my given opportunities, I influenced the confining society that marginalized me without letting it influence me. Running guns is a risky business. I made a decision. Having only five more hours to live will not dictate my behavior.

  <h3>2</h3>
  <p>Spy thriller a la 'James Bond' meets 'The Social Network'; the entrepreneuring milieu of Millennials is brought to foreign cultures with the college-aged Preston going big in international start-ups each time around in this book series, with a powerful spy watching his back in a second narrative in each installment. '2' completed, '2.1' begun.</p>
  <br><br><br><br>
  <h3>Higher Education</h3>
  <p>Kayla, a pretty, spunky India-American adopted college girl struggling with societal concerns and social isolation finds a handwritten book belonging to a historical group of wizards and witches that gives her life new meaning.</p>
  <h2>Movies:</h2>
  <h3>Untitled, High Concept</h3>
  <p>Seeking a writing group to Work For Hire with Mr. Payne on a concept of a successful professional who gets his cash stolen from his "secure" bank account and has to hire secretive "lobbyists" to track down the thieves, which turns into a fight to the death. The young up-and-coming, assault rifle toting, thoughtful professional "lobbyist" will be played by Mr. Payne and there will be several human condition elements in the writing that are remaining under an NDA for hard-hitting statements rather than an escapism action flick.</p>
  <h2>Software Applications:</h2>
  <p>An application for writers to sell their books to other writers which is premiering the patent-pending service of giving books maturity ratings automatically. The link for development hosting is provided below for all that are curious. If you upload a pdf up to about three pages long you will receive your maturity rating. The rest is in development and on approximately a 2018-2019 minimum viable product timeline (Open to help or backing, too.
